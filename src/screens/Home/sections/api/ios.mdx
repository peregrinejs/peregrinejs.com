Peregrine for iOS is written in 100% Swift. Use
[Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) interfaces
for type-safe serialization and de&shy;serialization. Use Apple's reactive
[Combine framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) to send
pub/sub events to [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev).
