Peregrine for Android is written in 100% Kotlin. Use the official [Kotlin
Serialization library](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/serialization.html) for
type-safe serialization and de&shy;serialization. Use reactive [asynchronous
flows](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html) to send pub/sub events to
[RxJS](https://rxjs.dev).
