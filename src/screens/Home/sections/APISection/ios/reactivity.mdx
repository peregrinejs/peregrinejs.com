Use Apple's [Combine
framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) to build reactive
data pipelines that send asynchronous events to the web layer.

```swift
struct KeyboardEvent: Codable {
    let state: String
    let height: Double
}

class Keyboard {
    @Published var keyboard: Event?
    ⋯
    init() {
        ⋯
        Publishers
            .MergeMany(willHidePublisher, didHidePublisher, willShowPublisher, didShowPublisher)
            .assign(to: &$keyboard)
    }
}
```

```typescript
const { Keyboard } = client

for await (const { state, height } of Keyboard.keyboard$) {
  console.log(`Keyboard is ${state}, height: ${height}`)
}
```
