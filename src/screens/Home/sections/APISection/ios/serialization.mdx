Peregrine for iOS is written in 100% Swift. Use
[Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) interfaces
for type-safe serialization and de&shy;serialization.

```swift
struct LocationResponse: Encodable {
    let lat: Double
    let lng: Double
}

func getLocation(call: Call) {
    â‹¯
    let response = LocationResponse(
        lat: location.coordinate.latitude,
        lng: location.coordinate.longitude
    )

    try! call.respond(with: response)
}
```

```typescript
const { lat, lng } = await client.getLocation()

console.log(`You are at Latitude: ${lat}, Longitude: ${lng}`)
```
