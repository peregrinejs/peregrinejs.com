   violate or infringe any 3rd party claims in regards to intellectual property,
   patents and/or trademarks and that to the best of its knowledge no legal
   action has been taken against it for any infringement or violation of any 3rd
   party intellectual property rights.

   environment, and that it does not infringe any of End User License Agreement

   hereby waives any claims regarding Software's incompatibility, performance,
   results, and features, and warrants that they inspected Software.

   must provide the email address used during purchase along with the order
   number included in the "payment received" and/or "your order is complete"
   email sent out after payment was made.

   Licensee shall only be entitled to a refund of the same amount they paid for

   restitution for any reason whatsoever, even if Software contains material
   flaws.

    10.1. Licensee hereby warrants to hold Licensor harmless and indemnify
    Licensor for any lawsuit brought against it in regards to Licensee's use of

    Licensor shall promptly notify Licensee in case of such legal action and
    request Licensee's consent prior to any settlement in relation to such
    lawsuit or claim.

    10.2. When redistributing Software or Modifications as part of Application,
    should Licensee offer support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this license, Licensee may act
    only on Licensee's behalf and sole responsibility, and not on behalf of the
    Licensor.

    class-action lawsuits against Licensor in relation to this license and to
    compensate Licensor for any legal fees, cost, or attorney fees should any
