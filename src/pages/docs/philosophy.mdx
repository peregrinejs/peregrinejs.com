# Philosophy

This page will explain **why** Peregrine was created and **who** it's meant
for.

## Why?

Peregrine was created after participating in the hybrid mobile app community
for almost 8 years and observing pain points with existing technologies.

Every solution took a _web-first_ approach: they attempted to mask the
complexities of iOS and Android, as if trying to brush them under the rug. The
intention was to provide the user with a [black
box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box), which tends to work better for
smaller abstractions. Unfortunately for users of these technologies, a black
box whose scope encompasses multiple entire platforms has a few downsides:

1. Platforms evolve quickly and **developers are left waiting for the black box
   to update**, leading to loss of end users and/or revenue and even crucial
   App Store deadlines being missed.
1. **Apps become reliant on obscure, brittle third-party code** that is subject
   to warnings or rejections from governing bodies. Getting this code updated
   can be a monumental task, often leading to forks of plugins or entire
   components of the black box itself.
1. Native functionality is pre-implemented, often leading to **lower fidelity
   data and interactions, platform conventions not being followed, etc**: a
   common reason why hybrid apps often don't _feel_ native.

### How is Peregrine different?

Peregrine takes a _native-first_ approach. The complexities of iOS and Android
are embraced, not shunned.

#### Documentation, not tooling

Peregrine does not have a CLI--or any tooling whatsoever, in fact. Instead of
using tooling to abstract the platform, Peregrine provides documentation for
beginners to start using each platform's native tooling directly.

"Peregrine app" isn't a phrase you'll find in these docs. Instead of trying to
encapsulate the native platforms, developers begin by creating a native app
with the IDE (or using an existing native app) and adding the Peregrine library
to it.

#### Recipes, not plugins

Traditionally, hybrid developers would select from a vast set of third-party
plugins in order to implement native functionality. In theory, this sounds
great! They allow you to get up and running very quickly.

In practice, however:

- **Plugins are highly coupled** to the platform and the native container
  itself. When either update, plugins can become incompatible, revealing a
  heavy dependency on third-party maintainers who often aren't the quickest to
  respond.
- **Plugin quality varies tremendously**. Plugins are often written by
  developers with little to no experience in native mobile apps and are often
  abandoned. This leaves timebombs scattered in your app that are outside of
  your maintenance purview.
- **Plugins are yet another black box**. When you choose a plugin off the
  shelf, you are sacrificing the chance to discover a solution on your own that
  may work better for your app.

Peregrine has _recipes_, not plugins. Recipes are premier code snippets and
associated instructions that are provided and maintained by the Peregrine
community that you can copy into your app. They represent the best and most
up-to-date way of doing something in iOS or Android, e.g. saving an image,
making the device vibrate, downloading a file, etc.

Recipes are often combined and then hooked up to remote interfaces to provide
native functionality to your web app.

## Who?

Peregrine does not claim to be the best choice for everybody. Existing
solutions have worked just fine for a significant amount of developers and
teams. Here's a list of roles we think Peregrine is and is not for:

Peregrine **is** for:

- Developers who are looking to rediscover hybrid app development.
- Developers who want full control over their app: code, structure, and UX.
- Developers who are curious and want to learn more about iOS and Android
  development.
- Developers who are already knowledgeable about iOS and Android development
  and want to incorporate web views(s) into their apps.
- Developers who are detail-oriented and want to be able to tweak every little
  thing.
- Developers who are security-minded.
- Developers who want to use web _and_ native platform for what they're both
  best at.
- Companies that want a minimal, programmatic way to build web micro-frontends
  into their native apps.

Peregrine **is not** for:

- Developers who want a framework to help them structure their app.
- Developers who want to push out an app as fast as possible.
- Developers who see iOS and Android as a means to an end.
- Companies that require contractual support. Perhaps in the future, paid
  support for Peregrine will be an option.
