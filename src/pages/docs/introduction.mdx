# Peregrine Docs

Welcome to the Peregrine documentation!

If you're new to Peregrine, we recommend starting by reading [the
introduction](#introduction) and then following the [Quickstart
Guide](/docs/quickstart).

## Introduction

Peregrine is a set of iOS, Android, and web libraries for building hybrid
mobile apps. For both iOS and Android, Peregrine provides an elegant way to add
feature-rich web screens, called **Web Frames**, to new and existing native
apps.

Peregrine Web Frames are secure by default, are pre&shy;configured for modern
web apps, and have an RPC API for bridging web and native.

Each platform's web\<-\>native bridge uses the most performant transport
possible, depending on the size of the payload and whether it's text or binary.

### Differences from Cordova and Capacitor

- Peregrine is **not** an entire mobile development framework like
  [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) or
  [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com).
- Peregrine does **not** have a CLI. Instead, developers use the platform and
  its native tooling to integrate the web portions of their app.
- Peregrine does **not** have plugins. Instead, developers use recipes to build
  tailored native functionality and then hook it up to connectors.
- Peregrine is multi-licensed, **not**
  [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) or
  [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License). Users can choose
  between [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) or
  one of the commercial licenses.

### Licensing Summary

To summarize the licensing in non-legalese, Peregrine is free to use if your
app is open source. If your app is closed source, then you must purchase an
appropriate commercial license. For apps with a single developer, the price is
a one-time fee of $5.

Please see the [Licenses](/license) page for a full description and legal
information.
