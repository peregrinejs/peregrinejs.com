# Peregrine Docs

Welcome to the Peregrine documentation!

If you're new to Peregrine, we recommend starting by reading [the
introduction](#introduction) and then following the [Quickstart
Guide](/docs/quickstart).

## Introduction

Peregrine is a set of iOS, Android, and web libraries for building hybrid
mobile apps. For both iOS and Android, Peregrine provides an elegant way to add
feature-rich web screens, called **Web Frames**, to new and existing native
apps.

Peregrine Web Frames are secure by default, are pre&shy;configured for modern
web apps, and have an RPC API for bridging web and native. Each platform's
web\<-\>native bridge uses the most performant transport possible, depending on
the size of the payload and whether it's text or binary.
