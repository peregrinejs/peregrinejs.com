# Differences from Cordova and Capacitor

There are several differences between Peregrine and existing solutions on the
market today such as [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) and
[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com). This page attempts to highlight these
differences in a unbiased way. For more in-depth explanations of these
differences and the reasoning behind them, see the
[Philosophy](/docs/philosophy) page.

## Technology

Peregrine has many technological differences between Cordova and Capacitor. To
learn more about the technical implementation of Peregrine, see the
[Architecture](/docs/architecture) page.

### Library, not Framework

Peregrine is **not** a mobile development framework, i.e. it does not provide
tooling or doctrine as to how your app is or should be structured.

- Peregrine does **not** abstract or hook into the native platforms.
- Peregrine does **not** have starter templates. Instead, developers install
  Peregrine libraries into their native and web apps.
- Peregrine does **not** have a CLI. Instead, developers use the platform and
  its native tooling.

### Extensions

Peregrine **discourages** plugins. Instead, to extend functionality, developers
can use recipes to build tailored native functionality and then hook it up to
connectors.

### Cordova Compatibility

Peregrine is **not** compatible with Cordova plugins. There are architectural
differences that make compatibility with Cordova plugins infeasible.

Migrating an app from Cordova or Capacitor to Peregrine is possible, but would
require replacing the entire native layer.

### Age

Cordova had its first release in 2009 (<YearsAgo from={2009} /> years ago!) and
remains largely the same in architecture and implementation. Capacitor was
started in 2017, but in order to maintain compatibility, much of Cordova was
copied into Capacitor's compatibility layer.

Peregrine was started in 2022 from the ground up, abandoning the Cordova
architecture altogether.

### Size

Mostly because of reduced scope and _not_ offering a compatibility layer with
Cordova, the [source code](https://github.com/peregrinejs) of each Peregrine
native library is about a tenth the size of the respective Cordova or Capacitor
platform.

### Language

The following table is a breakdown of the languages each project is written in.

      <td>Swift</td>
      <td>Kotlin</td>
      <td>TypeScript</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

Both Cordova and Capacitor support iOS plugins written in Objective-C and/or
Swift and Android plugins written in Java and/or Kotlin. Peregrine only
supports iOS connectors written in Swift and Android connectors written in
Kotlin.

## Stewardship

- Cordova is primarily managed and maintained by the [Apache Software
  Foundation](https://www.apache.org), a long-running, volunteer-based open
  source foundation.
- Capacitor is primarily managed and maintained by [Ionic](https://ionic.io), a
  Series B startup company founded in 2012.
- Peregrine is primarily managed and maintained by
  [@imhoffd](https://twitter.com/imhoffd), an ex-Ionic software engineer.

## Support

- Cordova offers no guarantee of support--free or otherwise.
- The Ionic sales department offers enterprise support for Capacitor.
- Peregrine offers no guarantee of free support. Perhaps in the future, paid
  support will be an option.

## Licensing

Unlike Capacitor ([MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)-licensed),
and Cordova ([Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License)-licensed),
Peregrine is multi-licensed under
[GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) and several
tiers of commercial licenses.

To summarize in non-legalese, Peregrine is free to use if your app is open
source. If your app is closed source, then you must purchase an appropriate
commercial license.

Please see the [Licenses](/license) page for a full description and legal
information.
