# Comparison with Cordova and Capacitor

This page compares Peregrine with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) and
[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com). Other hybrid mobile solutions such as
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev),
[NativeScript](https://nativescript.org), and [Turbo
Native](https://turbo.hotwired.dev) are out of scope for this page.

There are several differences between Peregrine and similar solutions such as
Cordova and Capacitor. This page attempts to highlight these differences in an
unbiased way. For more in-depth explanations of these differences and the
reasoning behind them, see the [Philosophy](/philosophy) page.

## Technology

Peregrine has many technological differences between Cordova and Capacitor. To
learn more about the technical implementation of Peregrine, see the
[Architecture](/docs/ios/architecture) page.

### Library, not Framework

Peregrine is **not** a mobile development framework, i.e. it does not provide
tooling or doctrine as to how your app is or should be structured.

- Peregrine does **not** abstract or hook into the native platforms.
- Peregrine does **not** have starter templates. Instead, developers install
  Peregrine libraries into their native and web apps.
- Peregrine does **not** have a CLI. Instead, developers use the platform and
  its native tooling.

### Extensions

Both Cordova and Capacitor provide an ecosystem around third-party plugins.
Plugin authors have deep access to most of the Cordova and Capacitor APIs,
which are used along with platform APIs to implement native functionality.

Peregrine does **not** have "plugins" in the same sense. Instead, developers
explicitly attach functions and observables to each [Web
Frame](/docs/ios/reference/web-frames) that the web layer will be able to
access. This is what's known as the remote interface.

While creating and distributing collections of native functionality is
possible, it should be **discouraged**. Instead, developers should use
[recipes](/philosophy#recipes-not-plugins) to build tailored native solutions
for their apps.

### Cordova Compatibility

Peregrine is **not** compatible with Cordova plugins. There are architectural
differences that make compatibility with Cordova plugins infeasible.

Migrating an app from Cordova or Capacitor to Peregrine is possible, but would
require replacing the entire native layer.

### Age

- Cordova had its first release in 2009 (<YearsAgo from={2009} /> years ago!)
  and remains largely the same in architecture and implementation.
- Capacitor was started in 2017, but extends Cordova code and has dependencies
  on Cordova libraries to support its compatibility layer.
- Peregrine was started in 2022 and built from the ground up, abandoning the
  Cordova architecture altogether.

### Size

Mostly because of reduced scope and _not_ offering a compatibility layer with
Cordova, the [source code](https://github.com/peregrinejs) of each Peregrine
native library is about a tenth the size of the respective Cordova or Capacitor
platform.

### Language

The following table is a breakdown of the languages each project is written in.

        Peregrine
      </Th>
      <td>Swift</td>
      <td>Kotlin</td>
      <td>TypeScript</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

Both Cordova and Capacitor support iOS plugins written in Objective-C and/or
Swift and Android plugins written in Java and/or Kotlin. Peregrine only
supports Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android.

## Stewardship

- Cordova is primarily managed and maintained by the [Apache Software
  Foundation](https://www.apache.org), a long-running, volunteer-based open
  source foundation.
- Capacitor is primarily managed and maintained by [Ionic](https://ionic.io), a
  company founded in 2012 (now owned by
  [OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com)).
- Peregrine is primarily managed and maintained by
  [@imhoffd](https://github.com/imhoffd), an Ionic alumni (2015-2020).

## Support

- Cordova offers no guarantee of support--free or otherwise.
- The Ionic sales department offers enterprise support for Capacitor.
- Peregrine offers no guarantee of free support. Perhaps in the future, paid
  support will be an option.

## Licensing

Unlike Capacitor ([MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)-licensed),
and Cordova ([Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License)-licensed),
Peregrine is multi-licensed under
[GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) and several
tiers of commercial licenses.

To summarize, Peregrine is free to use if your app is open source. If your app
is closed source, then you must purchase an appropriate commercial license.
