title: Observables
---

Observables in a remote interface are reactive streams of `Event` instances in
{platformLanguage} that, when connected to a Web Frame, can push data to the web
layer. They are implemented with
<T ios>[Combine Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine),
the reactive programming library that powers
SwiftUI</T><T android>[Asynchronous Flows](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html),
a powerful coroutine-based reactive programming library built by the Kotlin team
</T>, which means they are instances of
<T ios>[Publishers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher)</T><T android>[Flows](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/)</T>.

## Examples

Observables can be declared any number of ways. The following examples are for a
remote observable that sends events every time the network connection changes.

<T ios>

### Declared as a `@Published` property

Use the
[`@Published` attribute](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published)
to create an underlying publisher for the annotated property. Every time the
property is assigned a new value, the underlying publisher will emit the new
value to any subscribers.

The underlying publisher can be accessed with the `$` operator (`$connection` in
the following example).

```swift-diff
 class Network {
+    @Published var connection: Event?
 }
```

</T>

<T android>

### Declared as a class property

```kotlin-diff
 class Network {
+    val visible = MutableSharedFlow<Event>()
 }
```

</T>

<T ios>

### Declared as a `CurrentValueSubject`

A
[`CurrentValueSubject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/currentvaluesubject)
can be used to declare a publisher outside of a class.

```swift-diff
+let networkConnection = CurrentValueSubject<Event?, Never>(nil)
```

</T>

<T android>

### Declared as a variable

```kotlin-diff
+val networkConnection = MutableSharedFlow<Event>()
```

</T>

## Web Frame Configuration

For the following example, we'll be using an observable declared like the
following:

<T ios>

```swift
let networkConnection = CurrentValueSubject<Event?, Never>(nil)
```

</T>

<T android>

```kotlin
val networkConnection = MutableSharedFlow<Event>()
```

</T>

The observable reference can be passed directly to the Web Frame configuration.

<T ios>

Notice we must reset the type of the publisher to `AnyPublisher` by using
[`.eraseToAnyPublisher()`](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/erasetoanypublisher()>)
to conform to the
[`RemoteObservable` type](reference/web-frames#remoteobservable) expected by
Peregrine. This is known as type erasure in Swift.

</T>

<T android>

Although you can add an instance of `MutableSharedFlow` directly to the Web
Frame configuration, it is a good idea to convert it to an immutable flow first
by using
[`.asSharedFlow()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/as-shared-flow.html).

</T>

<T ios>

```swift-diff
 let configuration = WebFrame.Configuration(
     baseURL: ...
     functions: ...
     observables: [
+        "networkConnection$": networkConnection.eraseToAnyPublisher()
     ]
 )
```

</T>

<T android>

```kotlin-diff
 val configuration = WebFrame.Configuration(
     baseUrl = ...
     functions = ...
     observables = mapOf(
+        "networkConnection$": networkConnection.asSharedFlow()
     ),
 )
```

</T>

<Callout type="info">

Observables must end in a dollar sign (`$`) to denote a reactive property, as
popularized by [Cycle.js](https://cycle.js.org). This isn't merely
convention--the dollar sign is how ProxyClient knows it's an observable, not a
function.

### `Event`

Remote observables must emit `Event` objects, which represent a single value
sent to the web layer.

<T ios>

#### Initializers

##### `init?<T: Encodable>(_ json: T)`

Create an `Event` with any encodable object.

Structs (or classes) must implement the
[`Encodable` protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/encodable)
from Swift:

```swift
struct Connection: Encodable {
    let type: String
}
```

Then, objects can be passed to this constructor directly:

```swift
let event = Event(Connection(type: "wifi"))
```

This initializer will return `nil` if encoding fails (highly unlikely).

<Callout type="info">

Not all Events must be wrapped in objects. In Swift, many data types implement
the Encodable protocol: strings, booleans, ints, doubles, arrays, dictionaries,
etc.

</Callout>

</T>

<T android>

#### Constructors

##### `Event(val data: JsonElement)`

Create an `Event` object with arbitrary data.

Data must be JSON content on Android. One delightful way of creating arbitrary
JSON content is by using the
[`buildJsonObject`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.serialization/kotlinx-serialization-json/kotlinx.serialization.json/build-json-object.html)
helper from the KotlinX Serialization library:

```kotlin
val event = Event(buildJsonObject {
    put("type", "wifi")
})
```

##### `inline fun <reified T> Event(json: T)`

Technically not a constructor, this function can be used to instantiate Event
objects with any serializable object.

The easiest way to make a class serializable is by annotating it with
`@Serializable` from the KotlinX Serialization library:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.serialization.*
import kotlinx.serialization.json.*

@Serializable
data class Connection(val type: String)
```

Then, objects can be passed to this constructor directly:

```kotlin
val event = Event(Connection("wifi"))
```

This constructor will throw an error if encoding fails (highly unlikely).

<Callout type="info">

This function uses
[`Json.encodeToJsonElement`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.serialization/kotlinx-serialization-json/kotlinx.serialization.json/encode-to-json-element.html)
under the hood to serialize almost any data type: strings, booleans, ints,
doubles, as well as any instances of classes annotated with `@Serializable`. For
more information, see the docs for
[KotlinX Serialization](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/serialization.html).
