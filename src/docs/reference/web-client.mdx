## TypeScript API

### `ProxyClient`

A client that uses
[Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
to provide an idiomatic API.

To construct a `ProxyClient`, a generic parameter type must be provided which
adheres to the [`RemoteInterface`](#remoteinterface) type.

<Callout type="info">

These types are not verified against the actual runtime data the client sends
to and receives from the remote interface--it is up to you to keep the
TypeScript interface up to date.

Peregrine does not provide any tooling (see [Philosophy](/philosophy)), but
perhaps a third-party tool could generate these types from the remote
interfaces defined in the native platforms.

</Callout>

To demonstrate how the generic parameter is specified, the following example
defines two functions and an observable in the `MyRemoteInterface` type, which
is then passed into `ProxyClient` as it is constructed.

```typescript
export interface DeviceInfo {
  platform: string
  model: string
  manufacturer: string
}

export type ConnectionType = 'cellular' | 'wifi' | 'none'

export type MyRemoteInterface = {
  echo: (input: string) => Promise<string>
  getDeviceInfo: () => Promise<DeviceInfo>
  networkConnection$: AsyncGenerator<ConnectionType>
}

export const client = new ProxyClient<MyRemoteInterface>()
```

Peregrine clients don't connect automatically upon instantiation. The
[`connect()`](#connectcontext-window-promisevoid) method must be called.
Decoupling initialization from instantiation removes unintended side-effects
and allows you to connect and disconnect client(s) at will.

```typescript
client.connect(window)
```

<Callout type="info">

The `ProxyClient` class extends
[`StringClient`](https://github.com/peregrinejs/web/blob/main/src/StringClient.ts),
which can be used directly to avoid the use of proxies, if you prefer.

</Callout>

#### Methods

##### `connect(context: Window): Promise<void>`

Connect the client to the remote interface via the provided context.

##### `disconnect(): Promise<void>`

Disconnect the client from the remote interface.

##### `url(path: string): Promise<URL>`

Get a full [`URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) to a
subpath of a configured [path handler](reference/path-handlers).

In the following example, we'll get the URL of a file given the following path
handler configuration.

<T ios>

```swift { contentBefore: true, contentAfter: true }
    pathHandlers: [
        "/photos/": InternalStoragePathHandler(directory: photosURL)
    ]
```

</T>

<T android>

```kotlin { contentBefore: true, contentAfter: true }
    pathHandlers = mapOf(
        "/photos/" to WebViewAssetLoader.InternalStoragePathHandler(
            context,
            photosDir
        )
    ),
```

</T>

```typescript
const url = await client.url('/photos/IMG_1234.jpg')
```

##### `get<N extends keyof T>(name: N): T[N]`

Synchronously get the handle for a remote function or remote observable by
name.

<Callout type="warning">

You likely won't need to use this method. You can get handles by accessing
properties directly from `ProxyClient`. The following example highlights two
equivalent ways of getting an observable handle from the client.

```typescript
const handle1 = client.get('networkConnection$')
const handle2 = client.networkConnection$
```

</Callout>

##### <code>invoke\<N extends keyof RemoteFunctions\<T\>\>(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: N,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arg?: Parameters\<RemoteFunctions\<T\>[N]\>[0],<br />): ReturnType\<RemoteFunctions\<T\>[N]\></code>

Invoke a function from the remote interface by name with the provided argument.

<Callout type="warning">

You likely won't need to use this method. You can invoke remote functions by
invoking methods directly on `ProxyClient`. The following example highlights
two equivalent ways of invoking remote functions.

```typescript
const result1 = await client.invoke('echo', 'Hello World!')
const result2 = await client.echo('Hello World!')
```

</Callout>

### `RemoteInterface`

```typescript
type RemoteInterface = Record<
  string,
  RemoteFunction<any, any> | RemoteObservable<any>
>
```

### `RemoteFunction`

```typescript
type RemoteFunction<I, O> = (arg: I) => Promise<O>
```

Remote functions take exactly one parameter (which can be left omitted) and
always return a promise.

If successful, the promise will resolve with the data from the remote
interface. Data can be a string, an object, or (on iOS) an ArrayBuffer. If
unsuccessful, the promise will reject with a [`ClientError`
exception](#clienterror).

### `RemoteObservable`

```typescript
type RemoteObservable<T> = AsyncGenerator<T>
```

Remote observables get converted into async generators, which can be iterated
over by using
[for-await...of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of)
loops, like in the following example.

```typescript
for await (const connectionType of client.networkConnection$) {
  console.log(`Network connection changed: ${connectionType}`)
}
```

<Callout type="info">

For a more declarative API in reactive apps, it is easy to convert async
generators to [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev) observables. This can be an idiomatic
choice for simulating a single pipeline of asynchronous events across
platforms.

```typescript
import { from } from 'rxjs'

const connection$ = from(client.networkConnection$)

connection$.subscribe(connectionType => {
  console.log(`Network connection changed: ${connectionType}`)
})
```

</Callout>

### `RemoteFunctions`

```typescript
type RemoteFunctions<T extends RemoteInterface> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends RemoteFunction<any, any> ? T[K] : never
}
```

### `ClientError`

An exception that contains the message and an optional code from the remote
interface.

#### Properties

##### `readonly message: string`

The human-readable error message.

##### `readonly code: string | null`

The machine-readable error code.
