This page provides a brief overview of the Peregrine API to discuss terms and
concepts before diving a bit deeper into the implementation details.

## Overview

Peregrine has a library for web and a library for each native platform. The
native library provides the [Web Frame](reference/web-frames), which
encapsulates the web view. Developers create remote interfaces and attach them
to the Web Frame for web\<-\>native communication. Remote interfaces comprise
[functions](reference/functions) for request/response-style communication and
[observables](reference/observables) for pub/sub-style communication. The
implementation of this communication between web and native is often called the
_bridge_.
