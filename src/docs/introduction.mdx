## Introduction

Peregrine is a set of iOS, Android, and web libraries for building hybrid
mobile apps using web technologies. For both iOS and Android, Peregrine
provides an elegant way to add feature-rich web views, called [Web
Frames](reference/web-frames), to new and existing native apps.

**Core Features:**

- Performant bridge for web\<-\>native communication.
- Idiomatic, modern APIs for iOS, Android, and web.
- Web Views are preconfigured for <abbr title="Single Page Apps">SPAs</abbr>
  using [push state
  routing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API).
- Secure by default: no implicit device file access, native access is opt-in
  per Web View, HTTPS on Android, etc.
- A collection of recipes for writing native code succinctly.
