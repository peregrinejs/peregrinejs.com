title: Project Requirements
---

Peregrine has a [commitment to staying
modern](philosophy#the-peregrine-philosophy), so these requirements should not
be a surprise.

<T ios>

## Versions

- **iOS 14** or greater
- **Swift 5**

## SwiftUI

Web Frames can only be displayed in a
[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui) view hierarchy. By
implementing the
[`UIViewRepresentable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable)
protocol, Peregrine provides a declarative and extensive way to define
attributes and behavior of the web view.

If your app uses UIKit, it is possible to [interface with
SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/interfacing-with-uikit).

<T android>

## Versions

- **API 24+** (Android 7 or later)

## Kotlin

Peregrine is written entirely in Kotlin, so you must [set up your app to
compile Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/add-kotlin).
