This guide will help you get started quickly with Peregrine. You will learn how
to install Peregrine for {platform} and use it to display web contents in an
existing {platform} app. As a reminder, you can use the buttons above to switch
platforms for this documentation.

If you don't have an {platform} app, use <T
ios>[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)</T><T android>[Android
Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)</T> to create one.

<T ios>

## iOS Requirements

- **iOS 14+**
- **Swift 5+**
- **SwiftUI**. Peregrine provides a
  [`UIViewRepresentable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable)
  which must be used within a SwiftUI view hierarchy. If your app uses UIKit,
  it is possible to [interface with
  SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/interfacing-with-uikit).

<T android>

## Android Requirements

- **API 24+** (Android 7 or later)
- **Kotlin**. Peregrine is written entirely in Kotlin, so you must [set up your
  app to compile Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/add-kotlin).
